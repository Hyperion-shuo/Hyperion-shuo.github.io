## About These Competitions

### AI Olympics (IJCAI 2023)
The AI Olympics is a prestigious competition held at IJCAI (International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence), featuring challenging multi-agent reinforcement learning tasks. Our team achieved 1st place and was invited to give an oral presentation.

### Google Research Football (IEEE CoG 2022 & 2023)
Google Research Football is a challenging multi-agent environment that simulates football games. Teams compete by developing AI agents that can play full 11v11 football matches. Our team won the championship in 2022 and secured 2nd place in 2023.

### FightingICE (IEEE CoG 2021)
FightingICE is a fighting game AI competition where agents compete in real-time combat scenarios. Our team achieved 100% win rate in both PVE speedrun and PVP three-character tracks.

### KDD CUP 2020 - Ride-hailing
This competition focused on optimizing ride-hailing order dispatching using reinforcement learning, addressing real-world challenges in transportation systems.

### SMARTS Autonomous Driving
SMARTS (Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Training School) is a platform for autonomous driving research, where agents navigate complex traffic scenarios.
